{"id":"bzip2-rs-qmx","title":"Implement seek-table compatible format for block offsets","description":"Current block offset API provides (compressed_bit_offset, decompressed_byte_offset) mappings.\n  \nThe seek-table compatible format needs:\n- Per-block metadata: (compressed_bit_offset, decompressed_block_size)\n- Challenge: we only know block size AFTER decompressing the block\n- Options:\n  1. Buffer block data and emit size-based format\n  2. Two-pass approach: scan for offsets, then decompress\n  3. Store cumulative data and compute sizes retroactively\n\nDepends on #1 (block offset tracking)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hippytrail@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T13:08:34.456859+07:00","created_by":"hippietrail","updated_at":"2026-02-07T13:08:34.456859+07:00"}
